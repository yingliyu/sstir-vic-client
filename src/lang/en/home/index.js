  desc1: 'Genome sequencing is one of the etiological evidence for the diagnosis of suspected cases of COVID-19, and it is the basic work for the study of virus origin, mutation evolution, and pathogenic mechanism.',
  desc2: 'Our pipeline can automatically process raw next-generation sequencing data from upper respiratory tract sample, enabling the rapid detection of various viruses like COVID-19. Based on the analysis results, the online analysis can detect Relative viral load, accurately identify viral gene characteristics, monitor virus mutation trends, and provide data support for subsequent vaccine and drug development.',
