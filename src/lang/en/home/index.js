    'The platform is jointly built by Shanghai Science and technology innovation resource data center and Shanghai Pasteur Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences, which can provide virus detection and evolutionary analysis functions. The platform is based on the virus gene database and virus detection and analysis process integrated by Pasteur haopei team for many years. It was launched in February 2020 during the epidemic period. After iteration, the current platform can be compatible with the second generation gene sequencing data and nanopore gene sequencing data at the same time. Users only need to upload the sample data to complete the detection with one click, and the analysis results can be obtained in one hour, which helps the medical and research personnel can identify the virus more quickly and comprehensively.',
